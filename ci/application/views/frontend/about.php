                    <h3>Introduction</h3> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a society based on information, the role of technology has become more and more important.<p>Consequently, education management needs to focus on methods and tools 
                      which are able to combine the new available technology e.g. databases, cloud computing with tools traditionally used. <p> 
                    There are over 26,000 primary schools in Kenya. In most schools, especially among the public, education management operations and processes are paper-based.<p>

                    There has been little or no use of ICTs in data storage, performance analysis, record keeping and other school based tasks. <p>

                    However, there is a motivation to start using ICTs in schools to address this need.

                In a society based on information, the role of technology has become more and more important; consequently, also education research needs to focus on methods and tools which are able to combine the new available technology e.g. databases, cloud computing with analysis tools traditionally used.  
                <br /><br />
                Information technology has been associated with a shift in business strategy such as the shift in decision-making paradigms of the organization (Huber, 1990). The emerging computing model of Dynamic Data-Driven Applications Systems (DDDAS) fits well in crisis situations where rapid decision-making is essential (Mark Gaynor et al, 2005). Effective decision making in a crisis greatly depends upon immediate access and interpretation of local information within the context of the overall environment at any particular point in time.

                    There are over 18,000 public primary schools in Kenya. With the introduction of free primary education programme in 2003, there has been a massive increase in enrolment by pupils. The government and non-state actors have invested in development of public primary education.

                    Information and Communication Technology (ICT) integration in our public primary schools has not been given a keen interest for a long time. However, with the government’s plan of providing laptops to pupils, there has to be a paradigm shift in the view and uptake of ICTs in public primary education sector. The government has applied the use of ICTs in administration of national examinations. However, in the general management of all aspects of public primary education, the use of ICTs isn’t evident to a greater extent.

                    Over the years standard eight pupils sit for the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) Examination. Each school stores this data in files that gather dust in the shelves. The same records are replicated in the government education offices. If one wanted to know how his former school in the village has been performing in KCPE over a period of time, one would be compelled to travel to the school to access that data. A definite challenge is that this data lies in its raw form and the lack of analysis posesdifficultiesin understanding how a school has been fairing over the years.

                The purpose of the project is to develop an online data-driven portal where each public primary school shall create an account, upload and store KCPE and internal examinations’ data in a centralized database.

This data and information will be available to any interested party via the internet.
